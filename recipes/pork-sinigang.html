<h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pork sinigang is the ultimate comfort food! Made with pork ribs, vegetables, and tamarind-flavored broth, it's hearty and delicious on its own or served with steamed rice.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless pork shoulder, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>2 tbsp neutral cooking oil</li>
        <li>12 whole garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>salt and ground pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups concentrated cooking tamarind</li>
        <li>2 medium yellow onions, quartered</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fish sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 lb long beans cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, quartered</li>
        <li>10 oz water spinach</li>

    </ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot, heat the oil over medium-high until shimmering. Add the garlic and cook until toasted, 1 minute. Add the pork, season with 1½ tablespoons salt and ½ teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes. Add the tamarind, onion, fish sauce, and 10 cups water, and bring to a boil over high.</li>
        <li>Once the mixture comes to a boil, lower the heat to medium, cover and simmer until the pork is softened but not fully tender, about 1½ hours.</li>
        <li>Stir in the daikon, cover and continue to simmer until daikon is tender and the pork is yielding, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Uncover and discard the chiles. Add the long beans, eggplant, tomatoes and spinach and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve over rice. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
